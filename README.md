# Discord-Bots
A collection of all the discord bots I've made 

## UwUBot
### Description
A general annoyance bot based on the UwU/OwO meme. you can use UwUBot help to get a list of commands. 
It will generally reply to any message it receives with a variety of responses, and can even join voice chats to play audio clips. you can also say the word image and it will send to you a random image scrapped from 4chan as long as the image was tagged with either UwU or OwO and was posted in a or jp. 

### Special Requirements 
UwUBot will require my specific fork of the python 4scanner package inorder to use the image function. 

## Terry Davis Bot
### Description 
A Bot that sends quotes said by late programmer Terry Davis, inventor of TempleOS, whenever his name is mentioned. **Warning** it is important to note that Terry Davis has said some things that other may find offensive, this is not representative of my beliefs, however I do find the quotes to be occassionally humorous and representative of Terry Davis.

## JonTron Bot
### Description
The same as Terry Davis Bot but for the famous youtuber JonTron. 

## Tarot Bot
### Description
A bot that will give you your fortune. All you have to say is "Give me a fortune". Right now it only does single card fortunes, the hope is that in the near future it will also do 2 card and full 10 card readings. 

## Jail Bot
### Description
Interacting with UwUBot will give you a cringe role for a certain amount of time, then remove it. Currently it can give you the role, but crashes when removing it. 

## OwOBot / ΘωθBot
### Description
A bot that is a pun on the Egyption God of Knowledge's name in Greek being written at Θωθ. Asking Θωθ, what's this? <query> or OwO, what's this? <query> will use the wikipedia API to search for a valid wikipedia page and send it to you if one is found.
